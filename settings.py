Engineering Intern, GNE Corp S.A – San José Jan 2025 – March 2025
• Developed an AI-powered tool to generate reporting environments capable of handling database connectivity,
report-specific parameters, and data visualization
• Built an AI-based SQL query generator that interprets user prompt and the database’s schema to generate
accurate queries
• Collaborated closely with a team of data experts and delivered two end-to-end projects in a two-month
internship.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory Assistant LIMA - EIE (Universidad de Costa Rica) – San Pedro Jan 2024 – July 2024
• Trained Machine Learning models to predict interconnect delays and supported research in STA and physical
design as part of a university initiative at the intersection of EDA, digital design, and machine learning.
• Collected and processed over 1 million datapoints on physical design characteristics, significantly enhancing the
quality and volume of datasets used to train machine learning models for chip design prediction tasks.
• Collaborated in a cross-functional team with professors and peers in a microelectronics lab, improving research
throughput and contributing to ongoing academic research.
"""

USER_PROJECTS = """
Hybrid Machine learning Model for IC delay prediction | Python, Pandas, Scikit github.com/marvincastroo/
• Developed a hybrid ML model combining decision trees and linear regression to predict pre-routing delays in
digital circuits, achieving a 70% error reduction vs. open source tools
• Performed feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and extensive case testing to optimize model
performance and generalization
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom Peripheral Integration in SweRVolf SoC | Verilog, C
• Designed and implemented a digital clock peripheral in Verilog, integrated into the open-source SweRVolf
RISC-V SoC via the Wishbone bus interface
• Developed functional testbenches to validate clock behavior, timekeeping logic, and input-driven hour/minute
modifications.
• Mapped peripheral to dedicated memory addresses for register access, enabling full software control and
interaction within the SoC environment
